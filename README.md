Felin

----


Felin is a very light and simple 2D graphics library written in rust and wgpu-rs, it can render instances, texture arrays and basic 2D meshes like rectangles and squares.

It is meant as a learning project for myself and perhaps other beginners.

To check the examples, clone the project and run command

```
cargo run --example slider
cargo run --example text

```
